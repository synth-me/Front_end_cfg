# Front_end_cfg
That's a little front end system to help building and testing simple CFG or PCFG

## Disclaimer ##

1) Use both files in the directory , one needs to import another.

2)Some updates stil need to be done in future versions , some functions may not work due to the lack of actual possibilitites of doing it.
I would like to add a OCR to the system so that the user could scan their handwritted grammars, using pyteressarct, however, didn't work. For the sake of simpicity then i jst let as it is
Please make a push request if you feel that you can contribute anyway.
